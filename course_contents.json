Issues will range from the theoretical (what is information and how do humans construct it?), to the cultural (is life on the screen a qualitatively different phenomenon from experiences with earlier distance-shrinking and knowledge-building technologies such as telephones?), to the practical (what are the basic architecture of computing networks?).  Successful completion of this \"gateway\" course will give you the conceptual tools for an initial understanding of the politics, economics, and culture of the Information Age, providing a foundation for later study in Information or any number of other disciplines.

One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics. In certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in East Central Europe were often able to be more incisive, frank and provocative than is often the case in profit-driven Hollywood film. Talented and committed filmmakers crafted powerful films which the regimes had no ideological grounds to suppress; this tradition of critical filmmaking has continued into the post-Communist period. The films we study concern the Holocaust, women's lives under state socialism, and the ethno-nationalism that led to the wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. We view and discuss fourteen films from East Central Europe dealing with the above issues, considering the artistic structure of the films as well.\n         Read more   Save to My Dashboard Credits: 3.0 Median Grade:\n        A- Advisory Prerequisites: A knowledge of Russian is not required. \n        Scroll down for more Information\n       Course Sections  This table shows sections of SLAVIC 312 that are being offered in the Fall 2023 semester.

One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics. In certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in East Central Europe were often able to be more incisive, frank and provocative than is often the case in profit-driven Hollywood film. Talented and committed filmmakers crafted powerful films which the regimes had no ideological grounds to suppress; this tradition of critical filmmaking has continued into the post-Communist period. The films we study concern the Holocaust, women's lives under state socialism, and the ethno-nationalism that led to the wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. We view and discuss fourteen films from East Central Europe dealing with the above issues, considering the artistic structure of the films as well.\n         Read more   Save to My Dashboard Credits: 3.0 Median Grade:\n        A- Advisory Prerequisites: A knowledge of Russian is not required. \n        Scroll down for more Information\n       Course Sections  This table shows sections of RCHUMS 312 that are being offered in the Fall 2023 semester.
